## Data Set Used
The data for this project is sourced from the internal Blinkit sales dataset [Blinkit Dataset](https://github.com/pbisht2105/blinkit_sales_analyis_dashboard/blob/main/BlinkIT%20Grocery%20Data.xlsx).

- **Dataset Details**: 
  - The dataset includes transaction-level data for all items sold by Blinkit.
  - Key fields include `item_id`, `item_type`, `fat_content`, `total_sales`, `item_quantity`, `customer_rating`, `outlet_id`, `outlet_size`, `outlet_location`, and `outlet_establishment_type`.

The data is imported into **Power BI** from the Blinkit Grocery Data file, where various KPIs and charts are generated for analysis.

## Process

### 1. Data Import & Preprocessing in Power BI
   The raw sales data is imported into Power BI from Blinkit Grocery Data file. This data includes transactional details like `item_id`, `fat_content`, `item_type`, `total_sales`, and `customer_rating`. The data is cleaned and preprocessed in Power BI to ensure accurate calculations and visualizations.

### 2. Data Aggregation & KPI Calculation
   The following key performance indicators (KPIs) are calculated:
   - **Total Sales**: Sum of all sales transactions.
   - **Average Sales**: Average of all sales transactions.
   - **Number of Items**: Count of distinct items sold.
   - **Average Rating**: Average customer rating across all items.

### 3. Visualizing Insights in Power BI
   A range of charts are created to answer key business questions, such as:
   - **Total Sales by Fat Content**: A donut chart showing how fat content impacts total sales.
   - **Sales by Item Type**: A bar chart displaying the sales performance of different item types.
   - **Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales**: A stacked column chart to compare total sales segmented by fat content across outlets.
   - **Sales by Outlet Location**: A funnel map illustrating geographic sales distribution.

### 4. Dashboard Creation
   These visualizations are combined in a Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive, interactive view of the sales data. Users can explore the data by interacting with filters based on outlet type, fat content, item type, and location.
